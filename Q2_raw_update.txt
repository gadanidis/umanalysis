#   [1] "They're not very different. "
#   [2] "No, I think they're the same"
#   [3] "uh probably represents the speaker not sure how to frame next few sentences and um represents speakers are not really sure about the content."
#   [4] "uh-is more of a pause in thought    um-that you dont know what to say"
#   [5] "Personally, I think it's just a habit. Some people choose to say um while other say uh. However, personally, I'd say um more when I'm thinking of something to say and use uhh if I'm speaking faster than I can think of what I want to say. Uh is a placeholder for \"Hey. I'm still in the same train of thought. My brain just doesn't want to process as fast as I need it\" while umm would be like \"Oh, I haven't decided what I want to say. please hold.\""
#   [6] "\"um\" is used when thinking, whereas \"uh\" is used as fillers or to indicate doubt"
#   [7] "yes. Personally, i say um quite a lot without a clear reason. However, when I say \"uh\", then I might be more hesitant compared to saying \"um\""
#   [8] "I feel like um is used more when someone is trying to find their words than uh. Uh seems to be more so when someone is unsure about what to say rather than actually finding the words. "
#   [9] "Yes, when one individual speaker uses one or the other. But I also think that some people tend to use one more than the other. I think that 'um' is often used more when someone is consciously thinking about something and is willing to let other people know that they are hesitating or contemplating something, whereas 'uh' is more of a reflex"
#  [10] "I think um and uh are interchangeable."
#  [11] "I feel like they are usually associated with different connotations where um is mostly associated with thought whereas uh is associated with not knowing something. in my experience at least."
#  [12] "I think 'um' is a transition filler word while 'uh' is used when a persons draws a blank and might have problems better articulating"
#  [13] "They mean generally the same thing to me, but I think they differ in the way that they come up. For instance, I'd expect someone to say \"um\" if they were really having trouble finding the words to explain something since upon saying \"um\", their mouths close entirely to produce the /m/ sound. "
#  [14] "I think they have the same meanings, and people just have preferences of one over the other."
#  [15] "i feel like hearing um is colder and more harsh compared to hearing uh. uh kind of sounds like they just dont really know what to say so they start with uh. um sounds like the speaker doesnt really like the other person's idea or response"
#  [16] "I tend to associate \"uh\" with a more defensive voice; someone who is offended or caught off guard. \"Um\" sounds more pensive and relaxed to me."
#  [17] "To me, \"Um\" sounds more like when someone's unsure about something, and \"uh\" sounds like they have something to confess about."
#  [18] "I think \"um\" is used when a person is thinking about an answer. I think \"uh\" is used when somebody is hesitant or reluctant to answer."
#  [19] "Purely taste."
#  [20] "I don't know, I usually use both interchangeably, but I'll be interested to find out."
#  [21] "um seems more nervous than uh - uh seems like they lost their train of thought"
#  [22] "\"um\" is more likely used when the person is thinking about what he wants to say; whereas \"uh\" is more likely to be used when the person is a bit embarrassed to say something."
#  [23] "um is when you don't know, uh is when you are formulating? maybe"
#  [24] "yeah, \"um\" is more deliberate, like you're purposefully leaving a gap. \"uh\" is just like idk what's happening"
#  [25] "yes. um can be an indication of someone taking some time to think as they have a possible answer, but uh can be a sign that the person doesn't really have an answer. "
#  [26] "um is more self-aware and self-deprecating"
#  [27] "I think they're relatively similar."
#  [28] "'Um' holds a heavier weight when hesitating. Uh could be more casual, easier to transition. Um alludes to needing more time to process"
#  [29] "I think that um is said more to when the person is anxious and or trying to reorganise the things they are trying to say whereas I perceive uh as when someone does not know what they want to say and or is confused"
#  [30] "Not really."
#  [31] "um is trying not to reveal what you actually think and is more judgemental, uh is not knowing what to think and being confused"
#  [32] "I think um is used more for actual thinking/hesitance. Uh is more of a conversation filler"
#  [33] "I find 'um' to be more cautious whereas I'm more inclined to think that 'uh' indicates someone has an incomplete thought / lost their train of thought or began to speak without any real purpose"
#  [34] "I don't think they have different meanings more so one is preferred over the other based on that persons tendencies"
#  [35] "\"Um\" could be more of an uncertain term associated with not knowing what you're going to say. \"Uh\" feels like just a pause before getting on with what you're going to say."
#  [36] "In my opinion, \"um\" is more deliberate and \"uh\" is something used when someone is caught off guard or unprepared."
#  [37] "To me, um sounds more like a word to use when youre thinking about what to say next and uh could be portrayed as more hesitant or sometimes rude "
#  [38] "in passing conversation, i don't think they have different meanings. however, when they're drawn out in pause, i find that \"um\" sounds more polite and formal compared to \"uh\". in cases in say, a presentation, saying \"um\" for some reason makes me think that they have it more together than someone who says \"uh\""
#  [39] "Slightly, although I believe that both imply a kind of thinking meaning um seems somewhat deeper"
#  [40] "Yes, um would be nervous, hesitant and uh is less hesitant in a way."
#  [41] "I think \"uh\" is a little more casual"
#  [42] "It seems as though the use of 'um' as opposed to 'uh' makes one sound even more hesitant and unsure of what they are going to say. It's as if they need a longer filler-word to give them more time to think. "
#  [43] "I think \"uh\" is more vacuous and is said in other places (e.g. forgetting the next word in a sentence) whereas \"um\" has more meaning as a hedging word."
#  [44] "Um I typically perceive as being used more in instances where people know what they think and what they are going to say, but they want to pause for whatever reason. I typically view uh as meaning that the person needs a second to gather their thoughts."
#  [45] "I do not think that they have different meanings"
#  [46] "I don't think so? But maybe they're used differently when we're mid-saying vs thinking about what to say next"
#  [47] "um is more like thinking while uh is more like something is hard to say"
#  [48] "\"Um\" can express doubt, while \"uh\" just gives you time to think? But they can both be used in either way."
#  [49] "um sounds more as if it is an intentional pause to collect one's thoughts before continuing to speak, uh sounds like someone suddenly realized they have not fully thought out what to say and are now awkwardly trying to figure it out before they are seen as weird by those they are conversing with"
#  [50] "Depends on the context. Both can be used as fillers for hesitation but they (mostly uh) can also be used in a demeaning way"
#  [51] "In general, I don't think \"um\" and \"uh\" have different meanings."
#  [52] "Not sure."
#  [53] "not really; i think um is more uncertain & hesitant"
#  [54] "um i feel is more for thinking of an answer and uh is more for confusion or scrambling"
#  [55] "they seem about the same to me"
#  [56] "\"Uh\" seems to be used in more casual contexts (e.g. talking to friends and family), where you might use \"um\" in a more professional context (e.g. when you're giving a presentation and are thinking about what to say next, or when you're talking to a superior. "
#  [57] "I associate it as the same thing as just filler for conversation and even when people are nervous.  "
#  [58] "Personally I use um most often, perhaps this could vary by gender? or other social location factors?"
#  [59] "I do not associate um and uh with different meanings. However, I do think um seems more hesitant than using uh based on instinct. "
#  [60] "before the experiment i did not think about it but now i thing um is more feminine "
#  [61] "I think um means that the person need time to answer but uh means he/she does not want to answer or wants to change the topic."
#  [62] "Um is more like an \"I'm thinking of how to compile my thoughts into a proper response\" while uh is more like \"I don't have a response let me think of one on the spot\""
#  [63] "I think they are more or less the same"
#  [64] "Usually think of \"um\" as higher pitched than \"uh\"."
#  [65] "um sounds more uncomfortable and self-reflective. Uh would probably be used more when thinking about how you are going to reply to what someone has said, how you are going to judge them etc."
#  [66] "I personally use them pretty interchangeably as a word to fill while i am thinking of the next thing i want to say so specifically for me I find real no difference, but if you use it with maybe a specific tone, it might change their meanings "
#  [67] "uh might be more masculine"
#  [68] "Not sure"
#  [69] "i do think they are different. I think uh can be treated as a stop within the conversation."
#  [70] "In their usage, I believe 'um' and 'uh' have the same general purpose, but are used by different people as different mechanisms as I described in my above response (self-protection vs. giving oneself time to think while filling the silence)"
#  [71] "Um is more deliberate, uhh is more likely than um to be a pause in thought."
#  [72] "Uh seems to be the less intelligent form. Um seems more relatable, and even kind of cute sometimes"
#  [73] "um - more give me a min. uh - i'm not sure you're right ... im about to raise a counterpoint"
#  [74] "'Uh' might sound slightly less casual, and give off an impression of less intelligence, than 'um'"
#  [75] "\"um\" is used more when looking a specific word, while \"uh\" is used maybe when trying to think of an example/concept "
#  [76] "Um is used more when someone is hesitant about saying something like breaking bad news to someone whereas uh is used when people are thinking and unsure of what to say next"
#  [77] "No I don't, as personally I switch between both pretty easily."
#  [78] "To me, \"Um,\" is a word that would generally be used if you are pausing to think about what to say/how to answer a question, and I would think that \"Uh\" is generally used during hesitation, nervousness. "
#  [79] "They do not have a significant difference to me."
#  [80] "I think of \"um\" as meaning \"I'm thinking about something\", and \"uh\" as more of a filler word in a sentence."
#  [81] "Perhaps \"um\" means that the respondent is thinking of an answer they already know about and are trying to put their thought into words, and perhaps \"uh\" indicates that a person is caught by surprise or genuinely does not know how to respond or react."
#  [82] "Um is more nervous/hesitant, uh is more a placeholder when searching for something to say"
#  [83] "No, I believe they both are used as fillers"
#  [84] "they serve similar functions"
#  [85] "I suppose at first thought, I might take um to precede speaking about something more difficult or heavier. Uh seems a bit more casual, joke-y, or light."
#  [86] "Um is when you know what you have to say whereas uh is when you're thinking about what to say"
#  [87] "To me, 'um' sounds more hesitant whereas 'uh' sounds like the person is trying to think of how to elaborate on their previous point. 'Um' makes me feel like the person is really nervous."
#  [88] "Um is more unsure about things"
#  [89] "i think um gets used when you forget things where as uh is when you're pressed for an immediate response and cannot reply"
#  [90] "i think \"um\" in some contexts can come off as more judgemental, but i think both are generally the same"
#  [91] "I think they can be interchangeable"
#  [92] "Although they can probably be used interchangeably, uh seems to show hesitation before committing to saying something whereas um might signify that a person is thinking about how to phrase their thoughts better. "
#  [93] "Um sounds more considerate while uh sounds more casual."
#  [94] "No, I use them interchangeably. "
#  [95] "I would consider \"um\" to be used when the speaker is unsure about something, whereas \"uh\" is used when the speaker is not very willing to do something/is flustered. "
#  [96] "um could be used more often when confused and uh could be used when clueless ? there is a different intention for both"
#  [97] "uh is more of like if there is something you are genuinely unsure of, um is the same variant but a little more negative "
#  [98] "No. "
#  [99] "uh sounds more hesitant than um"
# [100] "I typically use um when I'm thinking and uh when I'm speechless"
# [101] "I think \"um\" is used when someone is trying to think of what to say when \"uh\" is more about hesitancy"
# [102] "no"
# [103] "in a everyday conversation, um and uh sound very natural. however, in a more professional context, such as an interview or during a meeting where you need to seem more intelligent, (kind of like you know what you are doing and belong there), saying um and uh can imply that person is unsure of what they are talking about, or give the impression that they are not as intelligent as they appear to be."
# [104] "I do not but only because I never really thought about whether they'd have different meanings"
# [105] "I do not think so, but it may have correlation to people's language system."
# [106] "I think that they generally have the same meanings"
# [107] "i feel like \"um\" is when you are not sure about something, but \"uh\" is when you are sure but don't want to argue what you think is right or speak your mind entirely."
# [108] "No"
# [109] "I think people use um when trying to gather thoughts to form a sentence while uh is used when trying to remember something"
# [110] "i think they are same because usually 1 do not distinguish them."
# [111] "I think uh can be dragged out longer than um and can be used to express confusion while um can maybe convey an unpleasant surprise."
# [112] "Um feels more \"dainty\" to me. Now that I think about it, I think I would use it a bit more in professional settings if I had to say \"um\" or \"uh\". \"Uh\" could get more \"annoying\" when stretched and sound more childish."
# [113] "I think um is used more in situations where a person is shy or nervous (i.e. um, excuse me), whereas uh is more frequently used in situations where you cannot think of a better word to use (i.e. uh-oh, or uh, I think I broke your mug)"
# [114] "I think they roughly mean the same. "
# [115] "I think they have the same meaning, but to me um seems more feminine and uh seems more masculine. Perhaps this is due to um being said the mouth closed, and uh being said with the mouth open. "
# [116] "\"Uh\" would suggest a level of annoyance, whereas \"um\" would relate to a general uncertainty."
# [117] "I feel like \"um\" has extra meanings, it can for instance be used to call someone's attention to something explicitly. Um and Uh share the feature that they are used in conversation when the speaker does not know what to say."
# [118] "No, I think they are interchangeable. "
# [119] "Not necessarily."
# [120] "I feel that \"um\" may be construed as being somewhat more feminine and \"uh\" as somewhat more masculine, but I based that purely on my experiences with conversation, and that I am more of an \"uh-er\" than an \"um-er\"."
# [121] "No, I think that they both serve the same purpose and therefore have the same definition. "
# [122] "I associate uh more with hesitation and um more with thinking/filler"
# [123] "For some reason, uh seems to have more of a loss for thoughts altogether and um seems to be that there is a thought but its not yet formed properly"
# [124] "uh is more uncertainty, um is more uncomfortable"
# [125] "I don't think I see them differently"
# [126] "Not really. I have always used them interchangeably in conversations. "
# [127] "They might be different? Some people use one more over the other (i.e. me). Maybe it's just me, but \"um\" sounds more feminine? "
# [128] "Not really.  they are different because umm makes it seem more like a person is thinking while uh makes a person seem less sure"
# [129] "I'm not sure"
# [130] "Uh sounds more like a filler to get time while um sounds more hesitant whether out of politeness or awkwardness/  "
# [131] "I think that um can mean that a person is considering something while uh is perhaps more of an involuntary hesitation."
# [132] "nope"
# [133] "I find when I"
# [134] "I don't think so. Perhaps they're both used to take a um, a pause."
# [135] "I feel like they essentially mean the same thing, but \"uh\" seems associated with less intelligence while \"um\" is more \"I'm thinking about it, considering it.\" Not that this is true, but that's like my knee-jerk interpretation."
# [136] "both mean the same to me"
# [137] "i think they could be used similarly, although uh might sound a bit with more hesistation or not sure"
# [138] "I don't think um and uh have different meanings. "
# [139] "No, I don't think they have different meanings."
# [140] "I think \"um\" suggests more uncertainty and nervousness about what one is about to say. \"Uh\" suggests more of a delay or that the speaker is searching for a particular word  "
# [141] "No"
# [142] "Not really."
# [143] "\"Uh\" sounds like you're thinking or processing information you've just learned, while \"um\" tends to sound like you're trying to find words to say and/or making up speech without thinking it through"
# [144] "I think they generally mean the same thing. In conversation, I think uh is probably more common than um."
# [145] "I feel that um is more used in social settings where the speaker is unsure or perhaps more introverted while I think uh is more of an informal yet connecting word used by friends and such."
# [146] "Not really, but I guess I would say that \"um\" is for a longer pause, while \"uh\" would be just a brief pause."
# [147] "I feel like they can be used interchangeably as they both can equate to hesitation "
# [148] "I tend to subconsciously correlate um with femininity and uh with masculinity. It's obviously not always true but it feels more natural "
# [149] "\"um\" may be a bit more polite possibly due to the fact that you have your mouth closed during this phrase while with \"uh\", your mouth is wide open and could be rude to someone talking to you if you held it for too long"
# [150] "um= socially don't want to say what they are thinking, uh= not sure cognitively how to say what they are thinking"
# [151] "Uh to me would be more used in a setting of surprise where one would need to think about the answer. Um sounds more uncomfortable to me, as if the person saying it knows the answer/what they want but is uncomfortable sharing that."
# [152] "Yes. Umm.. is like prolonging a decision and uh is for thinking purposefully"
# [153] "uh is like surprise to something and um is \"not sure\" may be the man is thinking about something"
# [154] "Uh to me seems more like filler for thinking, while um seems to be filler for making a decision while thinking"
# [155] "I think they are relatively the same, um seems a little less polite to me. "
# [156] "I dont think so"
